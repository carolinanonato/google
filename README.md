## Google Clone(ish)

Here's my first try with Next.js! It's a completely functional search website using Google's API. 
For the style, Tailwind CSS! Not my favorite thing in the world but it was nice to learn.

Also, first time I've deployed using Vercel: https://carolinas-googleclone.vercel.app/ 

Thanks Dr. Sahand Ghavidel for all the lessons!
